# GitHub Actions for KeyForge

Repo to test various GitHub Actions. Here a simple python script is started hourly to fetch the number of registered KeyForge decks from the main website. Furthermore, an action is included to run the black code formatter on all code pushed to the repo (in the scripts folder).

There are two posts on [4DCu.be](https://blog.4dcu.be) about this:
  * [Lights, Camera, GitHub, Actions: My Favorite GitHub Actions](http://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2021/10/15/GitHub-Actions.html) on how to use different GitHub Actions
  * [COVID-19 impact on KeyForge](http://blog.4dcu.be/programming/games/2021/08/20/COVID_and_KeyForge.html) where these data were used in a model to check the impact of the pandemic on the rate decks are registered.
