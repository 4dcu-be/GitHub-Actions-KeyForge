# GitHub Actions for KeyForge

Repo to test various GitHub Actions. Here a simple python script is started hourly to fetch the number of registered KeyForge decks from the main website. Furthermore, an action is included to run the black code formatter on all code pushed to the repo (in the scripts folder).

Will become a post on [4DCu.be](https://blog.4dcu.be) sometime in the near future (about using GitHub Actions) and once enough data is collected one about the popularity of KeyForge over time.
